# All-You-Can-Eat Sushi

### About
The inspiration for this project came during a visit to Nijiya Sushi in Medford, Massachusetts.
I was sitting right next to the kitchen door, so I got a clear view of how the servers appeared to be taking care of the customers. During this time, I noticed some clear gaps in effeciency and was inspired to try to create a elegant and streamlined solution for their restaurant. See my "About"
page for the rest of the story!


### Developer Notes
Clone the project, navigate into it's directory ("sushi"), and run "npm install".
Current notable dependencies include Async Storage and Camera. In the coming weeks, I
plan to also include QR Code Scanner dependencies, cloud server and storage, and
user authentication for Kitchen admins.

### Screenshots
Coming soon! I have significant updates to make. Once those are done, screenshots will be added.
