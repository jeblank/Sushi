# All-You-Can-Eat Sushi

### About
The inspiration for this project came during a visit to Nijiya Sushi in Medford, Massachusetts.
I was sitting right next to the kitchen door, so I got a clear view of how the servers appeared to be taking care of the customers. During this time, I noticed some clear gaps in effeciency and was inspired to try to create a elegant and streamlined solution for their restaurant. See my "About"
page for the rest of the story!


### Developer Notes
Clone the project, navigate into it's directory ("sushi"), and run "npm install".
Current notable dependencies include Async Storage and Camera. I attempted to add QR Code Scanner dependencies, but was not able to get it working properly.
